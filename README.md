# Calculus_SuspensionBridge

We have made the software for suspension bridge. It makes easier visualise and make complex calculation done in seconds.

To make the software run make sure you download the two python code files in the same folder.

The two files are :
1) main_calculus.py
2) cal_bridge.py
