# Calculus_SuspensionBridge

We have made the software for suspension bridge. It makes easier visualise and make complex calculation done in seconds.

It has multiple functions which helps you to calculate the different parameters of the bridge. 

You can change:
  1. Height
  2. Base point
  3. Length
  4. linear density of cable

According to your changes you will get perfect idea about the tension force at each point of bar of your bridge.

You can also see the variation in the tension due to the material you have used.
